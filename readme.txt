Add the entire Cloudstitch library of spreadsheet-powered visualizations and widgets with just a shortcode. 

== Description ==

Cloudstitch is a community of spreadsheet powered widgets you can add to any site -- things like product lists, data visualizations, and conference schedules. 

This plugin makes every widget on Cloudstitch available in WordPress with a simple Shortcode.

Adding a shaded electoral map of the US, for example, is as simple as adding the following line: `[cloudstitch widget="project-templates/electoral-map-visualization"]`

== Installation ==

Installation is easy! Just:

1. Upload and unzip `cloudstitch-wordpress.zip` in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Trying it Out ==

Try out the plugin by injecting demo widget already on Cloudstitch. Just add the following Shortcode to a page or post:

```
[cloudstitch widget="project-templates/electoral-map-visualization"]
```

== Using your own Cloudstitch Widgets ==

You can inject any widget that you've duplicated and customized on Cloudstitch. The general Shortcode format is:

```
[cloudstitch widget="USER-NAME/PROJECT-NAME"]
```

For example, let's say you visited Cloudstitch.io and duplicated [that electoral map widget](http://cloudstitch.io/project-templates/electoral-map-visualization).


Assuming your username is `TheIncredibleHulk`, you would end up with your own copy of the project hosted at a URL like this: `http://cloudstitch.io/TheIncredibleHulk/electoral-map-visualization`. 

Your custom Shortcode is thus `[cloudstitch widget="TheIncredibleHulk/electoral-map-visualization"]`

== Screenshots ==

1. Example of using a Cloudstitch shortcode for an electoral map
2. Example result of using that Cloudstitch shortcode
